           Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. 
           Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that 
           one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked 
           and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one 
           of the ones that became nothing.

            Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and 
            viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. 
            But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it 
            too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, 
            we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
